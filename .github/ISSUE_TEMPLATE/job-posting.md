<!-- Rules for posting! -->
<!-- 1. We allow direct posting only! No proxying through recruitment folks. -->
<!-- 2. Mention if the position is part or full time. -->
<!-- 3. Put contact details in there (an email address is good). -->
<!-- 4. Include a timeframe for the hiring. It's also helpful for us, because we need to tear the posting down at some point! -->
