  Want to give a talk? Or maybe you have a talk in mind that someone else could present?<br />:sparkles: Open a <a title="Create a github issue" href="https://github.com/reactbris/meetup/issues/new/choose">new github issue</a> to get started. :sparkles:
</p>

## :rainbow_flag: Community Participation

The meetup is run by folk in the community, so please feel encouraged to jump in on any talk [submissions](https://github.com/reactbris/meetup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22talk+volunteered%22) or [requests](https://github.com/reactbris/meetup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22talk+request%22) that you think you can add value to :pray:.

## :mailbox_with_mail: Job Postings

We're happy to help the industry grow, so if you're from a company that has a position opening _related to React_, then feel welcome to [create a posting](https://github.com/reactbris/meetup/issues/new/choose). Organisers will highlight the posting during future meetup events.

> ReactBris **does** accomodate **transparent job postings**. :thumbsup:  
> ReactBris **doesn't** accomodate **opaque or vague recruitment**. :thumbsdown:

## :gem: "Transparent" Job Postings

**Disclose** the organisation name behind the job.

### Examples

#### Good :thumbsup:: Deliberate company name disclosure and job details

_These are provided as examples, they're pretty sweet, but we aren't attributed to the companies :)._

* [Front End Developer at ABC News](https://github.com/BrisJS/meetups/issues/267)
* [Senior Software Engineer at Stacktrace](https://github.com/BrisJS/meetups/issues/269)

#### No good :no_entry_sign:: "Opaque" or "vague" recruitment messages

_These show a distinct disconnect from the community, which we're not about :)._

> "Hey all, I am looking for a frontend developer with react experience. Kindly check ( recruit.biz/developer-catch-all ) for more details."

> "Hey Peeps,Full Stack role available. Stack Laravel/React. Min 3 years commercial exp with PHP. email smith@recruit.biz thanks"

## ðŸ“– Where to post?

On our `reactbris/meetups` github repo, as new Issues!
